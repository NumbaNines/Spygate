7. Add export functionality:
   - Support export of approved clips to user-selected directory
   - Implement batch operations for multiple approved clips
   - Add file dialog integration for directory selection
   - Include status tracking and user notifications

8. Implement error handling and logging:
   - Create a comprehensive logging system (file + console output)
   - Implement graceful error handling for video file issues
   - Add user-friendly error messages with dialog boxes
   - Implement robust exception handling throughout application

9. Optimize performance:
   - Implement background threading for video analysis
   - Use hardware-tier adaptive settings
   - Ensure responsive UI during processing
   - Implement efficient memory management

10. Add professional UI components:
    - Custom video drop zone with drag/drop support
    - Progress bars with gradient styling
    - Professional button styling with hover effects
    - Consistent color scheme and typography

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify drag-and-drop functionality with various video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV)
   - Test the complete workflow from import to export with sample videos
   - Validate that all core modules are properly integrated and functioning
   - Verify clip detection accuracy with pre-annotated test videos
   - Test approve/reject functionality and ensure clips are properly categorized

2. Performance Testing:
   - Measure application startup time and resource usage
   - Test with videos of various lengths (1min, 5min, 30min, 2hr)
   - Monitor memory usage during extended processing sessions
   - Verify GPU utilization is optimized based on hardware tier
   - Test performance on all hardware tiers (ULTRA, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Validate frame skipping optimization works correctly (15, 30, 60, 90 frames)

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify all UI elements follow the FACEIT-style design guidelines
   - Confirm dark theme colors (#0f0f0f, #1a1a1a backgrounds) and accent colors (#ff6b35) are applied correctly
   - Test responsiveness of the interface during processing
   - Validate that progress indicators accurately reflect processing status
   - Test keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
   - Verify sidebar navigation (250px width) and three-panel layout function properly

4. Integration Testing:
   - Verify proper communication between all integrated modules
   - Test error propagation and handling across module boundaries
   - Validate that hardware detection properly affects processing parameters
   - Test game detection with multiple game versions
   - Verify that tier classification correctly optimizes processing
   - Test the multi-threaded analysis worker for UI responsiveness

5. Export Testing:
   - Test export functionality to user-selected directories
   - Verify exported clips maintain quality and contain correct segments
   - Test batch export with large numbers of clips
   - Validate status tracking and user notifications during export

6. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing functionality from individual modules works correctly
   - Verify fixes for known issues in component modules are preserved
   - Test backward compatibility with previously processed videos

7. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Prepare a test script covering the complete workflow
   - Have team members follow the script and report issues
   - Collect feedback on UI/UX and overall application flow
   - Verify the grid-based clip review interface (4 clips per row) is intuitive
   - Test the approve/reject workflow with visual feedback
