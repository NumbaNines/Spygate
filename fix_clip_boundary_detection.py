Fix for SpygateAI Clip Boundary Detection Issue

Problem: Clips continue playing for extra seconds even after a down change or play end.
Each clip should capture exactly one play, not multiple plays.

Root Cause Analysis:
1. The _analyze_play_boundaries method detects play starts but doesn't properly end clips
2. The system creates clips with hardcoded durations instead of detecting actual play ends
3. Down changes are detected but clips aren't ended when the next play starts

Solution: Implement proper play-end detection and clip boundary logic.
