# Task ID: 18
# Title: Enhance CV Pipeline with Universal HUD Detection and Adaptive Processing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the computer vision pipeline by implementing universal HUD detection, adaptive region sizing, and tier-based YOLO model selection, integrating with the existing detection system.
# Details:
1. Implement Universal HUD Detection:
   - Create a HUDDetector class using OpenCV
   - Train a lightweight CNN for multi-game HUD element detection
   - Implement adaptive thresholding for different lighting conditions
   - Store HUD layouts in a database for quick retrieval

2. Develop Adaptive Region Sizing:
   - Create an AdaptiveRegionSizer class
   - Implement dynamic ROI calculation based on detected HUD elements
   - Use player position heuristics to optimize processing regions
   - Integrate with FrameExtractor to apply ROI during preprocessing

3. Implement Tier-based YOLO Model Selection:
   - Create a YOLOModelSelector class
   - Define performance tiers (e.g., low, medium, high) based on hardware capabilities
   - Implement model loading and switching logic
   - Optimize model parameters for each tier (e.g., input size, confidence thresholds)

4. Integrate with Existing Detection System:
   - Modify the current detection pipeline to use the new components
   - Implement a fallback mechanism to previous detection method if new system fails
   - Create a configuration system to enable/disable new features

5. Optimize Performance:
   - Implement multi-threading for parallel processing of HUD detection and object detection
   - Use GPU acceleration where available
   - Implement caching mechanism for HUD layouts and detection results

6. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for each new component
   - Create detailed logging system for performance metrics and error diagnostics

Code example for YOLOModelSelector:

```python
class YOLOModelSelector:
    def __init__(self, hardware_tier):
        self.hardware_tier = hardware_tier
        self.models = {
            'low': YOLOv5n,
            'medium': YOLOv5s,
            'high': YOLOv5m
        }

    def get_model(self):
        return self.models[self.hardware_tier]()

    def update_tier(self, new_tier):
        if new_tier in self.models:
            self.hardware_tier = new_tier
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid tier: {new_tier}")
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests for each new class (HUDDetector, AdaptiveRegionSizer, YOLOModelSelector)
   - Test edge cases for HUD detection with various game screenshots
   - Verify correct model selection for different hardware tiers

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the entire CV pipeline with the new components
   - Verify that adaptive region sizing improves processing speed without loss of accuracy
   - Ensure seamless integration with existing detection system

3. Performance Testing:
   - Benchmark processing speed for different hardware tiers
   - Compare memory usage before and after implementation
   - Verify that GPU acceleration is properly utilized when available

4. Accuracy Testing:
   - Create a diverse test set of gameplay videos from various games
   - Compare detection accuracy between old and new systems
   - Ensure that universal HUD detection works across multiple games

5. Stress Testing:
   - Test system with high-resolution and high-fps videos
   - Verify stability during long processing sessions

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have beta testers try the new system on various hardware configurations
   - Collect feedback on performance improvements and any new issues

7. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure that all previously working features still function correctly
   - Verify that the fallback mechanism works when new system fails

8. Error Handling and Logging Test:
   - Simulate various error conditions and verify proper handling
   - Check that performance metrics and error logs are correctly generated
