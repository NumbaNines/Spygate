# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement TierClassifier and Optimizer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 4, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the TierClassifier to map hardware specs to performance tiers and the Optimizer to adjust frame processing parameters based on the tier, integrating with VideoProcessor for adaptive frame sampling.
# Details:
1. Implement TierClassifier class:
   - Define performance tiers (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Ultra)
   - Use HardwareDetector to get CPU, GPU, and RAM specifications
   - Create classification logic based on hardware thresholds
   - Implement get_tier() method returning the performance tier

2. Implement Optimizer class:
   - Define optimization parameters for each tier (e.g., frame sampling rate, resolution, processing quality)
   - Create optimize() method that takes the tier as input and returns optimized parameters
   - Implement adaptive strategies for different hardware capabilities

3. Integrate with VideoProcessor:
   - Modify VideoProcessor to use TierClassifier on initialization
   - Implement adaptive frame sampling using Optimizer recommendations
   - Add dynamic quality adjustment based on processing time and system load

4. Implement caching mechanism:
   - Store hardware classification results to avoid repeated detection
   - Implement periodic re-evaluation of hardware tier (e.g., every 24 hours or on system changes)

5. Create configuration file:
   - Define JSON structure for tier thresholds and optimization parameters
   - Implement config loading and validation in TierClassifier and Optimizer

6. Optimize VideoProcessor methods:
   - Modify frame extraction to use tier-based sampling rates
   - Adjust processing pipeline based on tier (e.g., reduce YOLO model complexity for lower tiers)

7. Implement logging and telemetry:
   - Log performance metrics and tier classification results
   - Create system for anonymized telemetry to gather real-world performance data

8. Design fallback mechanisms:
   - Implement graceful degradation for lower-tier hardware
   - Create override options for user-defined settings

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test TierClassifier with mock hardware specs for each tier
   - Verify Optimizer output for different tiers
   - Test VideoProcessor integration with various mock tiers

2. Integration Tests:
   - Run end-to-end tests with different hardware configurations
   - Verify adaptive behavior in VideoProcessor
   - Test performance impact of optimization on various hardware setups

3. Performance Benchmarks:
   - Create benchmark suite for different tiers
   - Measure frame processing times before and after optimization
   - Verify that lower tiers maintain acceptable performance

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test with extreme hardware configurations
   - Verify behavior with missing or invalid hardware information

5. User Experience Testing:
   - Conduct usability tests with different hardware setups
   - Gather feedback on application responsiveness and quality

6. Stress Testing:
   - Run continuous processing tests to verify stability
   - Test with large batch jobs to ensure consistent performance

7. Configuration Testing:
   - Verify correct loading and application of configuration file
   - Test with invalid configurations to ensure proper error handling

8. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure optimization doesn't negatively impact existing functionality
   - Verify that high-tier systems maintain full quality and performance
