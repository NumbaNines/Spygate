# Task ID: 25
# Title: Create Production-Ready PyQt6 Desktop Application
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 7, 16, 17, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a polished FACEIT-style desktop application that integrates all existing core modules into a complete auto-clip detection workflow with drag-and-drop functionality, YOLOv8 analysis, auto-detection of key moments, clip creation, and user approval/rejection.
# Details:
1. Set up the main application structure:
   - Create `main.py` as the entry point
   - Implement MainWindow class inheriting from QMainWindow
   - Design a modern FACEIT-inspired UI with dark theme (#121212 background, #3B82F6 accent)
   - Create responsive layout with QSplitter for adjustable panels

2. Implement the core application components:
   - Create a central dashboard with recent clips and statistics
   - Implement drag-and-drop zone for video import using QDragEnterEvent and QDropEvent
   - Add file menu with import/export options
   - Design settings panel for configuration options

3. Integrate existing modules:
   - Import and initialize hardware.py for system detection
   - Connect optimizer.py for performance tuning based on hardware
   - Integrate game_detector.py for game version identification
   - Link VideoTimeline component for playback and navigation
   - Connect YOLOv8 detection pipeline for analysis

4. Implement the complete workflow:
   - Create WorkflowManager class to orchestrate the process
   - Handle video import via drag-drop or file dialog
   - Implement progress indicators for analysis steps
   - Create ClipSuggestionPanel to display detected key moments
   - Add approve/reject buttons for each suggested clip

5. Design the clip review interface:
   - Create split view with video player and detection results
   - Implement frame-by-frame navigation
   - Add clip trimming controls with start/end markers
   - Include metadata editor for clip details
   - Implement batch approval/rejection functionality

6. Add export functionality:
   - Create ExportManager class for clip finalization
   - Support multiple export formats (MP4, GIF, etc.)
   - Implement quality settings for exports
   - Add social sharing options (optional)

7. Implement application settings:
   - Create SettingsManager class for persistent configuration
   - Add performance tuning options
   - Include detection sensitivity controls
   - Implement theme customization
   - Add keyboard shortcut configuration

8. Add error handling and logging:
   - Implement comprehensive exception handling
   - Create logging system with rotating file logs
   - Add user-friendly error messages
   - Implement crash recovery

9. Optimize performance:
   - Implement background processing for analysis
   - Use QThreadPool for parallel operations
   - Add caching for analyzed videos
   - Optimize memory usage for large videos

10. Polish the user experience:
    - Add tooltips and help documentation
    - Implement keyboard shortcuts
    - Create onboarding tutorial for first-time users
    - Add application update checker

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional testing:
   - Verify the application launches correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Test drag-and-drop functionality with various video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI)
   - Confirm file dialog import works correctly
   - Validate the complete workflow from import to export
   - Verify all buttons and controls function as expected

2. Integration testing:
   - Test hardware detection on various system configurations
   - Verify optimizer correctly adjusts settings based on hardware
   - Confirm game detection works for all supported games
   - Test YOLOv8 integration with different video qualities
   - Validate timeline component displays detection results correctly

3. Performance testing:
   - Measure application startup time (should be under 3 seconds)
   - Test memory usage during video analysis (should not exceed 2GB for 10-minute clips)
   - Verify CPU usage remains reasonable during analysis (below 80%)
   - Test with large videos (1+ hour) to ensure stability
   - Measure time to complete full workflow on reference videos

4. User experience testing:
   - Conduct usability testing with 5+ users
   - Verify UI responsiveness during heavy processing
   - Test keyboard shortcuts for all main functions
   - Verify error messages are clear and helpful
   - Test accessibility features

5. Regression testing:
   - Verify all existing module functionality remains intact
   - Test backward compatibility with previously analyzed videos
   - Confirm settings persistence across application restarts

6. Deployment testing:
   - Create and test installer packages for Windows, macOS, and Linux
   - Verify application updates correctly (if implemented)
   - Test installation on clean systems
   - Verify all dependencies are correctly bundled

7. Edge case testing:
   - Test with corrupted video files
   - Verify behavior when disk space is low
   - Test recovery from unexpected shutdowns
   - Verify behavior with extremely large or small videos
   - Test with unusual hardware configurations
