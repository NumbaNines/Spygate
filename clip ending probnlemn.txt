The problem is in the _finalize_previous_clips method (line 103-108). When a new play is detected:
  1. It creates a new clip for the new play
  2. It immediately finalizes ALL pending clips by setting their end frame to new_play_frame - 1

  This means the clip ends exactly 1 frame before the down change is detected, rather than capturing the full play
  including the down change.

  Additionally, the provisional end frame is set to frame_number + max_duration_frames (12 seconds), but clips are being
   finalized much earlier when the next play starts.

> yes but we need to make sure the 3 seconds wont prevent a new clip from starting



● You're absolutely right! We need to ensure that the post-play buffer doesn't interfere with the next clip's start. Let
   me analyze the current logic:


● Read(file_path: "/home/nines/dev/projects/Spygate/simple_clip_detector.py", offset: 80, limit: 30)

  ⎿      def _create_clip_info(self, play_state: PlayState) -> ClipInfo:
             frame_number = play_state.frame
             pre_snap_frames = int(self.fps * self.pre_snap_buffer_seconds)
             start_frame = max(0, frame_number - pre_snap_frames)

             max_duration_frames = int(self.fps * self.max_play_duration_seconds)
             provisional_end_frame = frame_number + max_duration_frames

             clip_info = ClipInfo(
                 start_frame=start_frame,
                 trigger_frame=frame_number,
                 end_frame=provisional_end_frame,
                 play_down=play_state.down,
                 play_distance=play_state.distance,
                 preserved_state=copy.deepcopy(play_state.raw_game_state),
                 created_at=play_state.timestamp,
                 status="pending",
             )

             self.active_clips.append(clip_info)
             print(f"🎬 CLIP CREATED: {clip_info.play_down} & {clip_info.play_distance}")
             return clip_info

         def _finalize_previous_clips(self, new_play_frame: int):
             for clip in self.active_clips:
                 if clip.status == "pending":
                     clip.end_frame = new_play_frame - 1
                     clip.status = "finalized"
                     print(f"🏁 CLIP FINALIZED: {clip.play_down} & {clip.play_distance}")




● I see the issue. The new clip starts with a 3.5 second pre-snap buffer (line 35), so its start_frame is frame_number -
   3.5*fps. If we add a 3-second post-play buffer to the previous clip, there could be overlap. Let me create a smart
  solution:

> deep think if thats the best than yes but



✻ Thinking…

  Let me think deeply about this clip ending problem. The user wants clips to:
  1. Capture the down change (not end before it)
  2. Not overlap with the next clip

  Current behavior:
  - Clip ends at new_play_frame - 1 when next down is detected
  - Next clip starts at new_play_frame - 3.5 seconds
  - This means the previous clip ends before the down change is shown

  The issue is that we're using the frame where the down change is DETECTED as the end point, but we need to capture a
  bit more to actually SEE the down change on screen.

  Let me think about alternatives:

  Option 1: Fixed post-buffer with overlap prevention
  - Add 2-3 seconds after down change detected
  - But cap it at next clip's start minus a small gap
  - This is what I proposed

  Option 2: Dynamic ending based on game state
  - Instead of ending when down changes, continue recording until:
    - Play clock resets (indicates new play starting)
    - Formation sets for next play
    - Or maximum duration reached
  - This would be more complex but more accurate

  Option 3: Overlap is actually OK
  - Maybe overlapping clips is fine?
  - The previous clip captures the transition
  - The next clip has full context
  - During export, user can trim as needed

  Option 4: Use YOLO indicators for end
  - End clip when next preplay_indicator appears
  - This would be most accurate but requires YOLO detection

  Actually, thinking about it more... in football broadcasts and game footage:
  - The down change happens DURING the transition between plays
  - We detect the down change when the HUD updates
  - But the actual play hasn't ended yet - players are still moving, refs are spotting the ball
  - So ending at down change detection minus 1 frame is definitely too early

  The simplest and most effective solution is probably:
  - When down change is detected, add a post-play buffer (2-3 seconds)
  - Cap it at the next clip's start to prevent overlap

  - This ensures we capture the full play conclusion and transition

  I realize overlap might actually be beneficial. Slight clip overlaps provide comprehensive context, allowing full
  capture of play transitions. By adding a simple 2-3 second post-buffer, we create more robust clip generation. The
  user can easily trim during editing if needed, making this approach both simple and flexible.


● Let me think deeply about the best approach for this.



●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Deep Analysis: Best Solution for Clip Endings

    Key Insights

    After deep consideration, I believe allowing slight overlap is actually the best approach. Here's why:

    1. Football Reality: When a down changes on the HUD, the play isn't truly over - players are still moving, refs are
    placing the ball, and the transition is happening. We need to capture this.
    2. Overlap is Good: Having slight overlap between clips ensures:
      - Each clip has complete context
      - No moments are missed between plays
      - Users get the full story of each play
    3. Simplicity: A simple fixed buffer is more reliable than complex calculations

    Recommended Solution

    def _finalize_previous_clips(self, new_play_frame: int):
        for clip in self.active_clips:
            if clip.status == "pending":
                # Add 2.5 second post-play buffer to capture the transition
                post_play_buffer_seconds = 2.5
                post_play_frames = int(self.fps * post_play_buffer_seconds)

                clip.end_frame = new_play_frame + post_play_frames
                clip.status = "finalized"

                duration = (clip.end_frame - clip.start_frame) / self.fps
                print(f"🏁 CLIP FINALIZED: {clip.play_down} & {clip.play_distance} ({duration:.1f}s)")

    Why This Works

    1. Captures Everything: The 2.5 second buffer ensures we see:
      - The down change on screen
      - Players getting up
      - Refs spotting the ball
      - Teams transitioning
    2. Overlap is ~1 second:
      - Previous clip extends 2.5s past down change
      - Next clip starts 3.5s before down change
      - Only ~1 second overlap in transition period
      - Both clips have full context
    3. Self-Contained Clips: Each clip tells the complete story of one play

    Alternative: If Overlap Must Be Avoided

    If you absolutely need no overlap, use the calculated approach from my previous suggestion. But I genuinely believe
    slight overlap is the better choice for football analysis.

    The simple 2.5 second buffer is the most elegant solution that ensures complete play capture.


✻ Thinking…

  The user has approved the plan. I should now implement the simple fix - adding a 2.5 second post-play buffer when
  finalizing clips. This will ensure the down change is captured in the clip.

✻ Thinking…

  Wait, there's an issue with the test. It shows that the first clip ends at frame 175, but the down change happens at
  frame 220. This is because we're finalizing based on when a NEW play is created, not when the down change is detected.

  Let me look at the logic again... When we detect a down change at frame 220, we:
  1. Create a new clip for down 2
  2. Finalize the previous clip (down 1)

  But we're finalizing it with new_play_frame + post_play_frames where new_play_frame is 100 (the trigger frame of the
  first play), not 220 (when the down change was detected).

  Actually, looking more carefully at the output, it seems the fix IS working correctly:
  - Clip 1 ends at frame 175 (which is 100 + 75 frames for 2.5 seconds)
  - But wait, that's wrong. It should be ending at 220 + 75 = 295

  I see the issue now. In _finalize_previous_clips, we're passing new_play_frame which is the frame where the NEW play
  is detected (220). So it should be calculating 220 + 75 = 295 for the end frame.

  Let me check the test output again... Actually, it looks like there's a logic error in my test. Let me fix the test to
   properly show what's happening.

     ✅ DOWN CHANGE CAPTURE VERIFICATION:
     --------------------------------------------------
     ❌ First down change (frame 1300) is NOT captured!
        Clip ends at frame 1075


✻ Thinking…

  I see the issue now! The problem is that when we finalize clips, we're adding the post-buffer to the TRIGGER frame of
  the first clip, not to the frame where the new down was detected.

  Looking at the code flow:
  1. At frame 1300, we detect down change from 1→2
  2. We call _finalize_previous_clips(1300)
  3. But the previous clip has trigger_frame = 1000
  4. We're setting end_frame = 1300 + 75 = 1375
  5. But that's being applied to the NEW clip, not the old one!

  Actually wait, let me trace through this more carefully...

  In _finalize_previous_clips, we're setting:
  clip.end_frame = new_play_frame + post_play_frames

  Where new_play_frame is 1300 (the frame where down 2 is detected). So clip 1 should end at 1300 + 75 = 1375.

  But the output shows clip 1 ending at frame 1075. That's 1000 + 75. So it seems like something else is happening.

  Oh! I think I see the issue. The test output might be wrong. Let me add some debug prints to see what's actually
  happening.


● I see the issue! Let me add some debug output to understand what's happening:

       114 +                 print(f"🏁 CLIP FINALIZED: {clip.play_down} & {clip.play_distance}")
       115 +                  print(f"   - End frame set to: {new_play_frame} + {post_play_frames} = {clip.end_frame}")

     ❌ First down change (frame 1300) is NOT captured!
        Clip ends at frame 1075


✻ Thinking…

  I see the issue now! The problem is that we're finalizing clips at the WRONG time. Look at what's happening:

  1. Frame 1000: First play detected (down 1)
    - Creates clip 1
    - Also calls _finalize_previous_clips(1000) which finalizes any pending clips
    - Since this is the first play, nothing to finalize yet
    - But it's IMMEDIATELY finalizing the clip we just created!
  2. Frame 1300: Down change detected (down 2)
    - Creates clip 2
    - Calls _finalize_previous_clips(1300) which should finalize clip 1
    - But clip 1 was already finalized at frame 1000!

  The issue is in the logic flow. When we detect the FIRST play, we're also calling _finalize_previous_clips which is
  finalizing the clip we just created.

  Let me check the code flow more carefully...


● I found the bug! The issue is in the order of operations. When the FIRST play is detected, it's calling
  _finalize_previous_clips(1000) which is incorrectly finalizing the clip that was just created. Let me trace through
  the code:


● Read(file_path: "/home/nines/dev/projects/Spygate/simple_clip_detector.py", offset: 50, limit: 10)

  ⎿          self.play_history.append(play_state)

             new_clip = self._detect_new_play(play_state)
             if new_clip:
                 self._finalize_previous_clips(frame_number)

             return new_clip

         def _detect_new_play(self, current_state: PlayState) -> Optional[ClipInfo]:
             current_down = current_state.down

============================================ Previous Conversation Compacted ===========================================
● Compact summary
  ⎿ This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized
     below:
    Analysis:
    Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

    1. **Initial Request**: User asked me to fix the Spygate clip segmentation pipeline with specific problems:
       - Wrong situations being clipped
       - Missing plays/downs entirely
       - Multiple plays combined into single clips
       - Requirement: EVERY down must be clipped individually

    2. **My Initial Analysis**: I examined the codebase structure, identified key components:
       - YOLO detection with 8 classes including `preplay_indicator` and `play_call_screen`
       - OCR processing pipeline
       - Clip management system
       - Play boundary detection logic

    3. **Key User Feedback #1**: User interrupted my initial plan saying "thats all good but we can use the preplay
    indicator yolo class and the playcallscreen to know when to start a clip"

    4. **My Response**: Created comprehensive fix using YOLO indicators for clip starts:
       - Created `spygate_clip_segmentation_fix.py` with YOLO-based start detection
       - Created supporting files (quick_fix, integration helpers, tests, documentation)
       - User approved pushing to GitHub

    5. **Git Operations**: User asked me to push to GitHub, but I couldn't due to authentication. User manually pushed.

    6. **Critical User Feedback #2**: User said "wait what folder in linux do I go to" - I confirmed they were in the
    correct directory `/home/nines/dev/projects/Spygate`

    7. **Missing File Issue**: User noted that `integrate_clip_fix.py` was mentioned in README but missing. I created
    it.

    8. **Model Change**: User switched to opus model

    9. **Burst Sampling Question**: User asked about burst sampling appearing in logs. I explained it was OCR burst
    consensus, not video burst sampling.

    10. **Key User Feedback #3**: User said to "only action the specific task... Please only look into the clips ending
    point. The starting point for the clips is perfect DO NOT MESS WITH THAT LOGIC But the clips are ending prematurely"

    11. **Remote Changes Issue**: User said "wait I applied the fixes remote so u dont see the updated version"

    12. **Git Merge**: User asked me to merge remote changes. I stashed local changes and pulled updates, which included
     a `SimpleClipDetector` class.

    13. **Current Issue Discovery**: I found that in `SimpleClipDetector`, clips were ending at `new_play_frame - 1`,
    cutting off before the down change.

    14. **User Clarification**: User said "it ends before the down changes" and then "no the clips are all under 10
    secs"

    15. **My Final Fix**: I identified the issue was in `_finalize_previous_clips` ending clips too early, and
    implemented a 2.5 second post-play buffer.

    16. **User's Final Concern**: "yes but we need to make sure the 3 seconds wont prevent a new clip from starting"

    17. **My Deep Analysis**: I concluded that slight overlap (about 1 second) is actually beneficial for complete
    coverage, and implemented the simple 2.5 second post-play buffer.

    The conversation shows a progression from a comprehensive overhaul to a very specific, targeted fix of just the clip
     ending logic in `SimpleClipDetector`.

    Summary:
    1. Primary Request and Intent:
       - Initial: Fix Spygate clip segmentation to ensure every down is captured as an individual clip, addressing wrong
     situations being clipped, missing plays, and merged plays
       - User clarified: Use YOLO `preplay_indicator` and `play_call_screen` classes for clip start detection
       - Final refined request: Only fix the clip ending logic - "The starting point for the clips is perfect DO NOT
    MESS WITH THAT LOGIC But the clips are ending prematurely"
       - Specific constraint: Ensure post-play buffer doesn't prevent new clips from starting

    2. Key Technical Concepts:
       - YOLO object detection with 8 UI classes (`preplay_indicator`, `play_call_screen`, `hud`, etc.)
       - OCR processing with PaddleOCR/EasyOCR for game state extraction
       - Frame-based video analysis with clip segmentation
       - Play boundary detection using game state changes (down changes)
       - Pre-snap and post-play buffers for complete play capture
       - SimpleClipDetector class for streamlined clip detection

    3. Files and Code Sections:
       - `/home/nines/dev/projects/Spygate/simple_clip_detector.py`
          - Core issue: Clips ending at `new_play_frame - 1` in `_finalize_previous_clips`
          - Fixed by adding 2.5 second post-play buffer
          - Original problematic code:
          ```python
          def _finalize_previous_clips(self, new_play_frame: int):
              for clip in self.active_clips:
                  if clip.status == "pending":
                      clip.end_frame = new_play_frame - 1
                      clip.status = "finalized"
          ```
          - Fixed code:
          ```python
          def _finalize_previous_clips(self, new_play_frame: int):
              for clip in self.active_clips:
                  if clip.status == "pending":
                      # Add 2.5 second post-play buffer to capture the transition
                      post_play_buffer_seconds = 2.5
                      post_play_frames = int(self.fps * post_play_buffer_seconds)

                      clip.end_frame = new_play_frame + post_play_frames
                      clip.status = "finalized"
          ```

       - `/home/nines/dev/projects/Spygate/spygate_clip_segmentation_fix.py`
          - Created comprehensive YOLO-based clip start detection system
          - Uses `preplay_indicator` and `play_call_screen` for precise play start detection

       - Other created files:
          - `quick_fix_spygate_clips.py` - One-command integration
          - `integrate_clip_fix.py` - Manual integration helper
          - `CLIP_SEGMENTATION_FIX_README.md` - Documentation
          - `test_clip_segmentation_fix.py` - Test suite
          - `test_clip_ending_fix.py` and `test_clip_ending_fix_v2.py` - Tests for the ending fix

    4. Errors and fixes:
       - **Missing integrate_clip_fix.py**: User noted it was referenced in README but didn't exist. I created it.
       - **Git merge conflicts**: Had to stash local changes and move conflicting files before pulling remote updates
       - **Clip ending issue**: Clips were ending at `new_play_frame - 1`, missing the down change. Fixed by adding 2.5
    second post-play buffer
       - **User feedback on overlap concern**: User worried about buffer preventing new clips. I analyzed and determined
     ~1 second overlap is beneficial

    5. Problem Solving:
       - Solved: Clips ending before down changes by adding post-play buffer
       - Solved: YOLO-based clip start detection implementation
       - Ongoing: Verifying the 2.5 second buffer works correctly with rapid plays

    6. All user messages:
       - "please deepthink # Critical Mission: Fix Spygate Clip Segmentation Pipeline"
       - "thats all good but we can use the preplay indictaor yolo class and the playcallscreen to know when to start a
    clip"
       - "well the methods u had for the stopping I want to use those just changes the clip start to what I said
    everything else u said I want"
       - "can u push to github"
       - "git push"
       - "wait what folder in linux do I go to"
       - "git push origin main"
       - "in ur readme u made it says coipy this file `integrate_clip_fix.py` but I dont see it"
       - "so are we using burst sampling?"
       - "ok but its popping up in the logs"

       - "yes but we need to make sure the 3 seconds wont prevent a new clip from starting"
       - "deep think if thats the best than yes but"

    7. Pending Tasks:
       - Test the clip ending fix with real game footage to ensure it captures down changes properly
       - Verify that the 2.5 second post-play buffer works correctly with rapid no-huddle plays

    8. Current Work:
       I was investigating why the first clip in my test was showing as not capturing the down change at frame 1300 when
     it should end at frame 1375. I noticed there might be an issue with the order of operations in `process_frame`
    where `_finalize_previous_clips` is called after creating a new clip, potentially finalizing the wrong clips.

    9. Optional Next Step:
       Fix the order of operations issue in `SimpleClipDetector.process_frame` to ensure clips are finalized correctly.
    The current code shows:
       ```python
       new_clip = self._detect_new_play(play_state)
       if new_clip:
           self._finalize_previous_clips(frame_number)
       ```
       This might be finalizing clips incorrectly when the first play is detected..
    Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue
    with the last task that you were asked to work on.
