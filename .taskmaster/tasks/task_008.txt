# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Formation Recognition
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to detect and classify offensive and defensive formations in gameplay clips.
# Details:
1. Collect formation training data:
   - Gather examples of common formations
   - Label player positions and roles
   - Create formation templates
2. Implement FormationRecognizer class:
   - Use template matching for basic recognition
   - Implement ML classification for complex formations
   - Support both offensive and defensive formations
3. Create formation database:
   - Store formation templates
   - Include formation characteristics
   - Link to playbooks
4. Implement player position mapping:
   - Map tracked objects to player positions
   - Identify formation variations
   - Detect pre-snap motion
5. Create formation visualization:
   - Overlay formation diagrams
   - Highlight key players
   - Show formation name and statistics
6. Implement formation statistics:
   - Track formation usage frequency
   - Analyze success rates by formation
   - Identify opponent tendencies
7. Add formation filtering in UI:
   - Filter clips by formation
   - Search by formation name
   - Group similar formations

# Test Strategy:
1. Accuracy tests against labeled formation dataset
2. Tests for formation variations
3. Tests for pre-snap motion handling
4. Performance tests for recognition speed
5. Comparison with human classification
6. Tests for different camera angles
7. Tests for formation filtering in UI
8. Integration tests with situation detection
