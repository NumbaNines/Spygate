# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement HardwareDetector Class
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a HardwareDetector class to detect and classify hardware specifications using psutil and OpenCV, integrating with the existing video processing pipeline, with support for multiple games and their specific requirements.
# Details:
1. Set up the HardwareDetector class:
   - Import necessary libraries: psutil, cv2, and any other required modules
   - Create a HardwareDetector class with methods for CPU, RAM, and GPU detection

2. Implement CPU detection:
   - Use psutil.cpu_freq() to get CPU frequency
   - Use psutil.cpu_count() to get the number of cores
   - Implement a method to classify CPU tier (e.g., low, medium, high) based on specs

3. Implement RAM detection:
   - Use psutil.virtual_memory() to get total and available RAM
   - Implement a method to classify RAM tier based on total RAM

4. Implement GPU detection:
   - Use OpenCV's cv2.cuda.getCudaEnabledDeviceCount() to check for CUDA-enabled GPUs
   - If CUDA is available, use cv2.cuda.DeviceInfo() to get GPU information
   - Implement fallback methods for non-CUDA GPUs (e.g., using subprocess to call 'nvidia-smi' or 'lspci')
   - Classify GPU tier based on detected specifications

5. Implement overall tier classification:
   - Create a method that combines CPU, RAM, and GPU tiers to determine an overall system tier
   - Define clear criteria for each tier (e.g., minimum specs for low, medium, high tiers)

6. Implement game version detection:
   - Create methods to detect installed game versions
   - Support multiple games with different version formats
   - Implement version parsing and comparison functionality
   - Store detected game versions for reference

7. Implement version-specific hardware requirements:
   - Create a database or configuration system for storing hardware requirements per game version
   - Implement methods to retrieve minimum and recommended specs for specific game versions
   - Add functionality to compare current hardware against game-specific requirements
   - Generate compatibility reports for each detected game

8. Create adaptive resource management:
   - Implement dynamic resource allocation based on detected hardware and game requirements
   - Create methods to adjust processing parameters (resolution, effects, etc.) based on game-specific needs
   - Add functionality to prioritize resources for the currently active game
   - Implement performance monitoring to adjust settings in real-time

9. Add cross-version compatibility checks:
   - Create methods to verify hardware compatibility across different game versions
   - Implement warning system for potential compatibility issues
   - Add functionality to suggest hardware upgrades for specific game versions
   - Generate compatibility matrices for multiple installed games

10. Implement hardware profile management:
    - Create a profile system to store hardware configurations for different games
    - Implement methods to save, load, and switch between hardware profiles
    - Add functionality to automatically select optimal profiles based on detected game
    - Include user override options for custom hardware profiles

11. Integrate with video processing pipeline:
    - Modify the existing video import or processing classes to use HardwareDetector
    - Adjust video processing parameters based on detected hardware tier and game requirements

12. Implement caching mechanism:
    - Store hardware detection results to avoid repeated detection on the same system
    - Cache game-specific hardware profiles and requirements
    - Implement a method to clear cache or force re-detection if needed

13. Error handling and logging:
    - Implement try-except blocks for each hardware detection method
    - Log any errors or unexpected results during hardware detection
    - Provide fallback values or estimations if specific hardware information can't be retrieved

14. Create a user-friendly hardware report:
    - Implement a method to generate a readable summary of detected hardware
    - Include game-specific recommendations and compatibility information
    - Add visual indicators for hardware that meets or fails to meet game requirements

15. Optimize performance:
    - Ensure hardware detection doesn't significantly impact application startup time
    - Consider running hardware detection in a separate thread if it takes too long
    - Implement lazy loading for game-specific requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests:
   - Create test cases for each hardware detection method (CPU, RAM, GPU)
   - Test tier classification logic with various hardware configurations
   - Test game version detection with different version formats
   - Verify version-specific hardware requirement checks
   - Use mock objects to simulate different hardware scenarios

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify that HardwareDetector integrates correctly with the video processing pipeline
   - Test that video processing parameters are adjusted based on detected hardware tier
   - Verify integration with multiple game detection and requirement systems
   - Test profile switching and resource allocation between different games

3. Performance testing:
   - Measure the time taken for hardware detection on various systems
   - Test performance impact when switching between different game profiles
   - Ensure hardware detection doesn't introduce significant delays in application startup
   - Benchmark resource management effectiveness for different games

4. Cross-platform testing:
   - Test on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure compatibility
   - Verify GPU detection works correctly with both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs
   - Test game detection across different platform-specific installations

5. Edge case testing:
   - Test with virtual machines or containers with limited resources
   - Verify behavior when certain hardware information is unavailable
   - Test with unusual game version formats or non-standard installations
   - Verify handling of games with missing or incomplete requirement specifications

6. User interface testing:
   - Check that the hardware report is displayed correctly in the UI
   - Verify that game-specific hardware recommendations are shown appropriately
   - Test profile management UI components and interactions
   - Verify that compatibility warnings are clearly presented

7. Regression testing:
   - Ensure that adding HardwareDetector doesn't break existing functionality
   - Verify that video processing still works correctly for all supported formats
   - Test backward compatibility with previously supported games

8. Stress testing:
   - Test hardware detection while other resource-intensive tasks are running
   - Verify that repeated hardware detections don't cause memory leaks
   - Test with multiple games running simultaneously
   - Verify resource management under high system load

9. Compatibility testing:
   - Test with different versions of psutil and OpenCV to ensure compatibility
   - Verify that the HardwareDetector works with all supported Python versions
   - Test with various game versions and their specific requirements

10. Security testing:
    - Ensure that hardware detection doesn't require elevated privileges
    - Verify that any logged hardware information doesn't contain sensitive data
    - Test for potential vulnerabilities in game version detection
    - Verify secure storage of hardware profiles and game requirements

11. Multi-game scenario testing:
    - Test detection and resource allocation with multiple games installed
    - Verify correct prioritization when switching between games
    - Test compatibility reporting across different game combinations
