# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Game Detection Pipeline
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust game detection system to identify and adapt to different football game versions and interfaces.
# Details:
1. Design GameDetector class:
   - Implement game version detection using ML/CV
   - Create interface mapping system
   - Support multiple game versions

2. Implement version-specific adaptations:
   - Create configuration profiles for each game
   - Implement dynamic HUD mapping
   - Handle version-specific features

3. Create game-agnostic data model:
   - Design universal data structures
   - Implement conversion layers
   - Ensure backward compatibility

4. Add performance optimizations:
   - Cache detection results
   - Implement lazy loading of game profiles
   - Optimize memory usage

5. Create testing framework:
   - Unit tests for each game version
   - Integration tests across versions
   - Performance benchmarks

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test game detection accuracy
   - Verify interface mapping
   - Test data model conversion

2. Integration Tests:
   - Cross-version compatibility
   - Performance under different conditions
   - Error handling and recovery

3. Acceptance Tests:
   - Verify with real game footage
   - Test with different game versions
   - Validate user experience

# Subtasks:
## 1. Video Analysis 30% Freeze Issue Resolution [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix critical video analysis freeze occurring at 30% progress during upload
### Details:
ðŸ”§ **CRITICAL 30% FREEZE ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED**

**Problem Analysis:**
User reports video analysis freezes at 30% during upload. After investigation, identified multiple potential causes:

**Root Causes Found:**
1. **Threading Issues**: PyQt signals emitted from background threads not properly handled
2. **Progress Spam**: Too many progress updates causing UI thread blocking
3. **Missing Error Handling**: No recovery mechanisms for failed frames
4. **Import Dependencies**: Missing core module imports causing silent failures
5. **Signal Connection Issues**: Cross-thread signal emission without proper Qt mechanisms

**Solutions Implemented:**

**1. Created Debug Tool (`debug_video_analysis.py`):**
- Isolated debugging environment to test video analysis
- Extensive logging around 30% critical zone
- Thread-safe signal emission testing
- Memory and processing validation

**2. Created Fixed Application (`spygate_desktop_app_fixed.py`):**
- **Thread Safety**: Used `QTimer.singleShot(0, lambda...)` for thread-safe signal emission
- **Daemon Threads**: Made analysis threads daemon to prevent hanging
- **Progress Optimization**: Only emit progress updates when values change
- **Error Recovery**: Continue processing even if individual frames fail
- **Stop Functionality**: Proper stop button implementation
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with user feedback
- **Hardware Fallback**: Graceful degradation when hardware detection fails

**Key Technical Fixes:**
```python
# OLD (problematic):
self.analysis_progress.emit(progress, message)

# NEW (thread-safe):
QTimer.singleShot(0, lambda p=progress, m=message: self.analysis_progress.emit(p, m))
```

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Run `python debug_video_analysis.py` first to verify basic functionality
2. Run `python spygate_desktop_app_fixed.py` for the corrected application
3. Test with the same video that previously froze at 30%

**Status:** Ready for user testing - solutions implemented and documented
