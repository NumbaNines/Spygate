# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Play Detection System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to identify and classify specific plays in gameplay clips.
# Details:
1. Collect play training data:
   - Gather examples of top 20 common plays
   - Label play types and variations
   - Create play sequence templates
2. Implement PlayDetector class:
   - Use sequence analysis for play detection
   - Implement ML classification for play types
   - Support both offensive and defensive plays
3. Create play database:
   - Store play templates and characteristics
   - Include success rate statistics
   - Link to formations and playbooks
4. Implement play sequence analysis:
   - Analyze player movement patterns
   - Identify key play elements
   - Detect play variations
5. Create play visualization:
   - Overlay play diagrams
   - Highlight key routes and assignments
   - Show play name and statistics
6. Implement play statistics:
   - Track play usage frequency
   - Analyze success rates by play
   - Identify opponent tendencies
7. Add play filtering in UI:
   - Filter clips by play type
   - Search by play name
   - Group similar plays

# Test Strategy:
1. Accuracy tests against labeled play dataset
2. Tests for play variations
3. Tests for play sequence analysis
4. Performance tests for detection speed
5. Comparison with human classification
6. Tests for different camera angles
7. Tests for play filtering in UI
8. Integration tests with formation recognition
