# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling & Recovery System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust error handling and recovery system for the OCR enhancement pipeline that can handle corrupted data, engine failures, and edge cases with graceful degradation.
# Details:
1. Design Error Handling Architecture:
   - Create ErrorHandler base class with standardized error codes and recovery strategies
   - Implement specialized handlers for different subsystems (OCR, motion detection, object tracking)
   - Develop centralized logging system with severity levels and contextual information

2. Implement Data Corruption Recovery:
   - Create DataValidator class to detect corrupted frames and video segments
   - Implement recovery strategies: interpolation, nearest-neighbor substitution, partial processing
   - Add checksums and validation for all data persistence operations

3. Develop Engine Failure Simulation & Recovery:
   - Create FailureSimulator for testing system resilience
   - Implement graceful degradation paths for each critical component
   - Design component-specific restart mechanisms with state preservation
   - Fix TierOptimizer enum comparison bug using proper type checking and equality operators

4. Implement Comprehensive Exception Handling:
   - Create custom exception hierarchy for different error types
   - Add try-except blocks with specific recovery actions for each component
   - Implement global exception handler as last resort
   - Add detailed error reporting with stack traces and context information

5. Create Monitoring System:
   - Implement real-time error rate monitoring dashboard
   - Add performance degradation detection
   - Create automated alerts for critical failures
   - Implement error pattern analysis for proactive maintenance

6. Design Fallback Mechanisms:
   - Create simplified processing pipelines for degraded operation
   - Implement feature toggles for disabling problematic components
   - Add configuration for minimum viable functionality requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Create comprehensive test suite with 100+ edge cases
   - Test each error handler with simulated failures
   - Verify correct error code generation and logging
   - Validate recovery mechanisms restore expected state

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test error propagation between components
   - Verify system-wide recovery from component failures
   - Validate graceful degradation paths maintain core functionality
   - Test TierOptimizer enum comparison fix with various input types

3. Chaos Engineering:
   - Use FailureSimulator to randomly inject failures during operation
   - Verify system stability under cascading failure conditions
   - Test recovery from simultaneous multi-component failures
   - Measure recovery time and data loss metrics

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure system performance under error conditions
   - Verify error handling doesn't introduce significant overhead
   - Test recovery time for different failure scenarios
   - Validate monitoring system accuracy and alert timing

5. User Experience Testing:
   - Verify appropriate user feedback during error conditions
   - Test UI responsiveness during recovery operations
   - Validate error messages are clear and actionable
   - Ensure critical functionality remains accessible during degraded operation
