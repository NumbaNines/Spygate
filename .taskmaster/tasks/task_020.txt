# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Game Detection Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust game detection system to identify and adapt to different football game versions and interfaces.
# Details:
1. Design GameDetector class:
   - Implement game version detection using ML/CV
   - Create interface mapping system
   - Support multiple game versions

2. Implement version-specific adaptations:
   - Create configuration profiles for each game
   - Implement dynamic HUD mapping
   - Handle version-specific features

3. Create game-agnostic data model:
   - Design universal data structures
   - Implement conversion layers
   - Ensure backward compatibility

4. Add performance optimizations:
   - Cache detection results
   - Implement lazy loading of game profiles
   - Optimize memory usage

5. Create testing framework:
   - Unit tests for each game version
   - Integration tests across versions
   - Performance benchmarks

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test game detection accuracy
   - Verify interface mapping
   - Test data model conversion

2. Integration Tests:
   - Cross-version compatibility
   - Performance under different conditions
   - Error handling and recovery

3. Acceptance Tests:
   - Verify with real game footage
   - Test with different game versions
   - Validate user experience
