# HUD State Transition Analysis for Automatic Game Event Detection

## 🎯 Core Concept

Track changes in HUD elements between frames to automatically detect game events with high confidence. This eliminates the need for complex visual analysis of on-field action.

---

## 📊 **1. DOWN PROGRESSION EVENTS**

### **Successful First Down Conversions**

```
BEFORE: 1st & 10 → AFTER: 1st & 10 (new field position)
BEFORE: 2nd & 7 → AFTER: 1st & 10
BEFORE: 3rd & 5 → AFTER: 1st & 10
BEFORE: 4th & 2 → AFTER: 1st & 10 + SAME possession
```

**Detection Logic:**

- ANY down → 1st & 10 = First down achieved
- Track field position change to measure gain
- **Special Case**: 4th down success requires possession indicator to stay same

### **Failed Down Progression (No First Down)**

```
BEFORE: 1st & 10 → AFTER: 2nd & X
BEFORE: 2nd & 7 → AFTER: 3rd & X
BEFORE: 3rd & 5 → AFTER: 4th & X
```

**Detection Logic:**

- Down number increases by 1
- Distance may change based on gain/loss
- Field position tracks yardage gained/lost

### **Fourth Down Outcomes**

```
4th Down SUCCESS: 4th & X → 1st & 10 + SAME possession
4th Down FAILURE: 4th & X → 1st & 10 + DIFFERENT possession
```

---

## 🏆 **2. SCORING EVENTS**

### **Touchdown (6 Points)**

```
Home Score: X → X+6 = Home team touchdown
Away Score: X → X+6 = Away team touchdown
```

**Additional Context:**

- Usually followed by extra point attempt (Score +1) or 2-point conversion attempt
- Field position typically resets after scoring play
- Possession changes to opponent after kickoff

### **Safety (2 Points)**

```
OFFENSE gets 2 points: Score X → X+2 + possession changes + opponent gets ball
DEFENSE gets 2 points: Score X → X+2 + same team keeps possession + gets ball back
```

**Special Logic:**

- Rare but important for complete tracking
- Possession handling is unique (scoring team gets ball back)

### **Extra Point/Two-Point Conversion**

```
After Touchdown:
+1 Point: Extra point successful
+2 Points: Two-point conversion successful
+0 Points: Extra point/conversion failed
```

---

## 🔄 **3. POSSESSION CHANGES**

### **Turnover on Downs**

```
4th & X + possession indicator CHANGES = Turnover on downs
- Down resets to 1st & 10
- Field position stays approximately same
- Possession indicator flips
```

### **Interception/Fumble**

```
INTERCEPTION Detection:
- Possession indicator CHANGES (only HUD element moving)
- All other HUD elements remain STATIC for ~2 seconds
- Down/distance/field position unchanged initially
- Eventually updates to:
  • 1st & 10 at turnover location (normal interception)
  • +6 points to score (pick six touchdown)

FUMBLE Detection:
- RED BOX with "FUMBLE" text appears ABOVE the score_bug
- Possession indicator may also change
- Eventually updates to:
  • 1st & 10 at turnover location (fumble recovery)
  • +6 points to score (fumble return touchdown)

NO HUDDLE Detection:
- RED BOX with "No Huddle" text appears ABOVE the score_bug
- Play clock runs down SUPER FAST to lower number
- No possession change (same team continues)
- Accelerated tempo offense indicator
```

---

## ⏰ **4. TIMING EVENTS**

### **End of Quarter/Half**

```
Game Clock: XX:XX → 15:00 (new quarter)
Game Clock: XX:XX → 00:00 → 15:00 (quarter change)
Quarter: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th
```

### **Two-Minute Warning**

```
Game Clock reaches 2:00 in 2nd or 4th quarter
- Automatic timeout
- Clock stops
```

### **Timeout Usage**

```
Team Timeouts: 3 → 2 → 1 → 0
- Game clock stops
- Play clock may reset
```

---

## 🏟️ **5. FIELD POSITION ANALYSIS**

### **Red Zone Entry/Exit**

```
Entry: Field position → "OPP 20" or closer
Exit: Field position moves beyond "OPP 20"
```

### **Goal Line Situations**

```
Goal Line: "OPP 5" or closer
Hash Mark Analysis: Left/Right/Center positioning becomes critical
```

### **Field Position Measurement**

```
Yards Gained = Previous field position - Current field position
Example: OPP 30 → OPP 15 = 15 yards gained
```

---

## ⚠️ **6. SPECIAL SITUATIONS**

### **Penalty Outcomes**

```
Down stays same + field position changes = Penalty applied
- 5-yard penalty: Field position changes by 5
- 15-yard penalty: Field position changes by 15
- Automatic first down: Any down → 1st & 10
```

### **Measurement/Replay**

```
Same down/distance repeated = Under review or measurement
- HUD may flicker or show "UNDER REVIEW"
- Eventually resolves to first down or next down
```

### **Clutch Play (Situational Success)**

```
CLUTCH PLAY Detection:
- 4th down situation + 1+ yard gained = Clutch conversion
- Game-winning/tie-breaking score in final 2 minutes = Clutch score
- Combines down/distance tracking + time context + score differential

Criteria:
• 4th & X → 1st & 10 (successful 4th down conversion)
• Score change in final 2:00 that breaks tie or takes lead
• High-pressure situation success
```

### **Turnover Play (Critical Loss)**

```
TURNOVER PLAY Detection:
- Interception: Possession indicator changes + static HUD period
- Fumble lost: RED BOX "FUMBLE" + possession change
- Safety: Opponent scores 2 points + possession change
- Regardless of yardage - any turnover is critical

Criteria:
• Possession indicator flips to opponent
• RED BOX "FUMBLE" text + possession change
• Score +2 points for opponent (safety)
• Critical negative outcome for analysis
```

### **Defensive Stand Play (Strong Defense)**

```
DEFENSIVE STAND Detection:
- Major loss: -10 to -6 yards (e.g., sack for -8 yards)
- Turnover on downs: 4th down failure (0 yards, possession change)
- Elite defensive performance forcing negative outcomes
- Strong defensive impact measurement

Criteria:
• Field position: OPP 25 → OWN 37 = -12 yard sack
• 4th & 3 → possession change (0 yards, defense holds)
• Major negative yardage forcing difficult situations
• Elite defensive stand analysis
```

### **Poor Play (Loss or No Gain)**

```
POOR PLAY Detection:
- Field position moves BACKWARD (-5 to -1 yards)
- Zero yards gained with pressure indicators
- Sack, tackle for loss, or failed play execution
- Tracks ineffective offensive performance

Criteria:
• Field position: OPP 25 → OWN 30 = -5 yard loss
• Down progression with increased distance (1st & 10 → 2nd & 15)
• Zero gain: Same field position + down increases
• Negative yardage performance analysis
```

### **Average Play (Moderate Gain)**

```
AVERAGE PLAY Detection:
- 0-9 yards gained, no first down achieved
- Standard down progression (1st → 2nd → 3rd)
- Exception: Critical short yardage (4th & 1 conversion)
- Baseline offensive performance measurement

Criteria:
• Field position: OPP 25 → OPP 18 = 7 yard gain
• Down progression: 1st & 10 → 2nd & 3 (normal advancement)
• No first down unless critical situation (4th & 1)
• Moderate success analysis baseline
```

### **Big Play (Explosive Gain)**

```
BIG PLAY Detection:
- 20+ yards gained with explosive field position change
- 10+ yards on 3rd/4th down that achieves first down
- Game-changing momentum and field position impact
- Elite offensive performance measurement

Criteria:
• Field position: OPP 35 → OPP 10 = 25 yard explosive gain
• 3rd & 12 → 1st & 10 (big conversion under pressure)
• 4th & 8 → 1st & 10 (explosive short yardage execution)
• Explosive gain analysis for elite performance
```

### **Good Play (Solid Gain)**

```
GOOD PLAY Detection:
- 10-19 yards gained with strong field position improvement
- 5-9 yards on 3rd/4th down that achieves first down
- Above-average execution and yardage advancement
- Quality offensive performance measurement

Criteria:
• Field position: OPP 25 → OPP 10 = 15 yard gain
• 3rd & 7 → 1st & 10 (successful conversion under pressure)
• 4th & 3 → 1st & 10 (good short yardage execution)
• Solid gain analysis for quality performance

## 🔍 **DETECTION CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS**

### **HUD Visibility Issues**

- **Problem**: HUD may disappear during replays
- **Solution**: Use last known state, wait for HUD return
- **Timeout**: If HUD missing >5 seconds, pause detection

### **Rapid State Changes**

- **Problem**: Multiple changes in quick succession
- **Solution**: Buffer states, analyze sequences
- **Example**: TD (6 pts) + Extra Point (1 pt) + Kickoff (possession change)

### **Close Game Clock**

- **Problem**: Clock format changes (:45 vs 0:45)
- **Solution**: Normalize clock format before comparison

### **Hash Mark Detection**

- **Problem**: QB position affects strategy analysis
- **Solution**: Track hash mark trends for field position strategy

## 📈 **CONFIDENCE SCORING**

### **High Confidence Events (95%+)**

- Score changes (exact point values)
- Down progression (clear transitions)
- Possession changes (indicator flip)

### **Medium Confidence Events (80-95%)**
