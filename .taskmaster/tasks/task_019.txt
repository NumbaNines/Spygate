# Task ID: 19
# Title: Integration Testing of Adaptive System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Perform comprehensive integration testing of the adaptive system across all hardware tiers, validate performance metrics, document results in Task-Master, and prepare for Django web transition with YOLOv8 integration.
# Details:
1. Setup test environment:
   - Configure test machines representing each hardware tier (low, medium, high)
   - Install latest version of the adaptive system on each machine
   - Set up YOLOv8 environment using the ultralytics library
   - Prepare test data sets covering various game scenarios

2. Develop test suite:
   - Create test cases for each major feature (video import, frame extraction, motion detection, object tracking, situation detection, formation recognition, play detection)
   - Include edge cases and stress tests for each hardware tier
   - Implement automated test scripts using pytest
   - Add specific tests for YOLOv8 object detection functionality

3. Execute tests across hardware tiers:
   - Run full test suite on each tier
   - Monitor and log system performance metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, processing speed)
   - Test adaptive behavior by simulating different hardware conditions
   - Evaluate YOLOv8 performance across different hardware configurations

4. Validate performance metrics:
   - Compare actual performance against expected benchmarks for each tier
   - Analyze scalability of the system across different hardware configurations
   - Identify any performance bottlenecks or inconsistencies
   - Benchmark YOLOv8 detection speed and accuracy

5. Test integration points:
   - Verify correct interaction between all system components
   - Ensure seamless data flow from video import to final analysis output
   - Test export functionality and stream recording features
   - Validate integration between YOLOv8 and other system components

6. Document results in Task-Master:
   - Create detailed test reports for each hardware tier
   - Log any bugs or issues discovered during testing
   - Document performance metrics and comparisons
   - Include specific YOLOv8 performance metrics

7. Prepare for Django web transition:
   - Review current system architecture and identify components to be migrated
   - Create a migration plan outlining steps for transitioning to Django
   - Develop prototype Django views and models for key features
   - Ensure YOLOv8 integration is properly designed for the Django framework

8. Conduct final review:
   - Hold team meeting to discuss test results and migration plan
   - Prioritize any necessary fixes or optimizations
   - Update project roadmap based on integration test findings

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify test environment setup:
   - Confirm correct installation and configuration on all test machines
   - Validate that each hardware tier is correctly represented
   - Verify YOLOv8 and ultralytics library are properly installed and configured

2. Execute automated test suite:
   - Run pytest scripts and verify all tests pass across all tiers
   - Check test coverage and ensure all major features are included
   - Validate YOLOv8 detection accuracy with test datasets

3. Manual testing and verification:
   - Perform hands-on testing of key features on each hardware tier
   - Verify adaptive behavior by manually adjusting hardware conditions
   - Test YOLOv8 detection with various video inputs

4. Performance metric validation:
   - Use profiling tools to confirm accuracy of collected metrics
   - Compare results against predefined benchmarks for each tier
   - Verify that performance scales appropriately across tiers
   - Measure and document YOLOv8 inference times on different hardware

5. Integration point testing:
   - Manually test data flow through the entire system
   - Verify correct functionality of export and stream recording features
   - Test integration between YOLOv8 and downstream analysis components

6. Task-Master documentation review:
   - Ensure all test results are properly documented
   - Verify completeness and clarity of bug reports and performance logs

7. Django transition preparation:
   - Review migration plan with senior developers
   - Test prototype Django components for basic functionality
   - Verify YOLOv8 integration in Django environment

8. Final review checklist:
   - Confirm all planned tests were executed
   - Verify all results are documented and analyzed
   - Ensure migration plan is comprehensive and approved by team leads
