# Task ID: 26
# Title: Create Integrated Production Desktop Application
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 7, 16, 17, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the main production desktop application that integrates all existing core modules into a polished FACEIT-style interface with a complete auto-clip detection workflow, from video import to user approval of detected clips.
# Details:
1. Design and implement the main application architecture:
   - Create a PyQt6-based main window with modern FACEIT-style UI
   - Design a modular architecture to integrate all core components
   - Implement a responsive layout with dark theme and accent colors

2. Implement the drag-and-drop video import interface:
   - Create a drop zone with visual feedback for file acceptance
   - Support multiple video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI)
   - Show progress indicators during file loading
   - Integrate with existing VideoImport functionality

3. Integrate core modules with proper dependency injection:
   - HardwareDetector: For system capability detection
   - TierClassifier: For performance tier determination
   - GameDetector: For game version identification
   - PerformanceMonitor: For real-time performance tracking
   - GPUMemoryManager: For optimized GPU resource allocation

4. Implement the analysis workflow pipeline:
   - Create a workflow controller to manage the processing stages
   - Integrate YOLOv8 detection with progress visualization
   - Implement auto-detection of key moments using the SituationDetection module
   - Add clip generation based on detected moments
   - Create a clip review interface for user approval/rejection

5. Design the clip review interface:
   - Create a grid view of detected clips with thumbnails
   - Implement clip preview on hover/selection
   - Add approve/reject buttons with keyboard shortcuts
   - Include batch operations for multiple clips
   - Implement clip metadata editing

6. Implement settings and configuration panel:
   - Create a settings dialog for application configuration
   - Add options for detection sensitivity, output formats
   - Include hardware utilization preferences
   - Implement profile saving/loading

7. Add export functionality:
   - Support multiple export formats (MP4, GIF, etc.)
   - Implement batch export of approved clips
   - Add export presets for different platforms (YouTube, Twitter, etc.)
   - Include progress tracking for exports

8. Implement error handling and logging:
   - Create a robust error handling system
   - Implement detailed logging with different severity levels
   - Add a log viewer within the application
   - Implement crash recovery mechanisms

9. Optimize performance:
   - Implement background processing for heavy tasks
   - Use multithreading for UI responsiveness
   - Leverage GPU acceleration where available
   - Implement memory management for large videos

10. Add help and documentation:
    - Create an integrated help system
    - Add tooltips and contextual help
    - Include sample workflows for new users

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional Testing:
   - Verify drag-and-drop functionality with various video formats
   - Test the complete workflow from import to export with sample videos
   - Validate that all core modules are properly integrated and functioning
   - Verify clip detection accuracy with pre-annotated test videos
   - Test approve/reject functionality and ensure clips are properly categorized

2. Performance Testing:
   - Measure application startup time and resource usage
   - Test with videos of various lengths (1min, 5min, 30min, 2hr)
   - Monitor memory usage during extended processing sessions
   - Verify GPU utilization is optimized based on hardware tier
   - Test performance on minimum spec hardware to ensure usability

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify all UI elements follow the FACEIT-style design guidelines
   - Test responsiveness of the interface during processing
   - Validate that progress indicators accurately reflect processing status
   - Test keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
   - Conduct user testing with sample workflows

4. Integration Testing:
   - Verify proper communication between all integrated modules
   - Test error propagation and handling across module boundaries
   - Validate that hardware detection properly affects processing parameters
   - Test game detection with multiple game versions
   - Verify that tier classification correctly optimizes processing

5. Export Testing:
   - Test export functionality with various formats and settings
   - Verify exported clips maintain quality and contain correct segments
   - Test batch export with large numbers of clips
   - Validate export presets produce expected results

6. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing functionality from individual modules works correctly
   - Verify fixes for known issues in component modules are preserved
   - Test backward compatibility with previously processed videos

7. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Prepare a test script covering the complete workflow
   - Have team members follow the script and report issues
   - Collect feedback on UI/UX and overall application flow
