   - Detect camera angle changes
   - Identify replay segments
4. Add region of interest (ROI) analysis:
   - Focus on field area vs. HUD elements
   - Track ball movement
   - Identify player clusters
5. Implement motion-based frame sampling:
   - Adaptive frame rate based on motion intensity
   - Skip static segments
6. Create motion metadata storage:
   - Store motion data in SQLite
   - Link to video timeline markers
7. Optimize for performance:
   - GPU acceleration where available
   - Efficient algorithm selection based on hardware
