5. Test integration points:
   - Verify correct interaction between all system components
   - Ensure seamless data flow from video import to final analysis output
   - Test export functionality and stream recording features

   - Confirm all UI components work with the FACEIT-style dark theme

7. Document results in Task-Master:
   - Create detailed test reports for each hardware tier
   - Log any bugs or issues discovered during testing
   - Document performance metrics and comparisons
   - Include specific YOLOv8 performance metrics
   - Document confirmed system specifications (Windows 11, 16 CPU cores, 31.2GB RAM)
   - Record successful completion of all 11 core tests (5 YOLOv8 integration tests, 6 main component tests)

8. Prepare for Django web transition:
   - Review current system architecture and identify components to be migrated
   - Create a migration plan outlining steps for transitioning to Django
   - Develop prototype Django views and models for key features
   - Ensure YOLOv8 integration is properly designed for the Django framework

9. Conduct final review:
   - Hold team meeting to discuss test results and migration plan
   - Prioritize any necessary fixes or optimizations
   - Update project roadmap based on integration test findings
   - Address the relative import issues in main.py as a priority item

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify test environment setup:
   - Confirm correct installation and configuration on all test machines
   - Validate that each hardware tier is correctly represented
   - Verify the integrated YOLOv8 and ultralytics library are functioning properly
   - Confirm system specifications match expected test environment (Windows 11, 16 CPU cores, 31.2GB RAM)

2. Execute automated test suite:
   - Run pytest scripts and verify all tests pass across all tiers
   - Check test coverage and ensure all major features are included
   - Validate YOLOv8 detection accuracy with test datasets
   - Test the AutoClipDetector class with various inputs
   - Focus on CPU-optimized testing as CUDA is not available
   - Verify all 11 core tests continue to pass (5 YOLOv8 integration tests, 6 main component tests)

3. Manual testing and verification:
   - Perform hands-on testing of key features on each hardware tier
   - Verify adaptive behavior using the implemented hardware-tier detection
   - Test YOLOv8 detection with various video inputs
   - Verify CPU-based performance optimization under different load conditions

4. Performance metric validation:
   - Use profiling tools to confirm accuracy of collected metrics
   - Compare results against predefined benchmarks for each tier
   - Verify that performance scales appropriately across tiers
   - Measure and document YOLOv8 inference times on different hardware
   - Test performance optimization features under various conditions
   - Confirm detection speeds match or exceed the benchmarks (1.170s for random images, 0.038s for demo images)

5. Integration point testing:
   - Manually test data flow through the entire system
   - Verify correct functionality of export and stream recording features
   - Test integration between YOLOv8 and downstream analysis components
   - Validate the complete auto-clip detection workflow end-to-end
   - Test fixes for the relative import issues in main.py

6. UI testing:
