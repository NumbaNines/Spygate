  - safety>=2.0.0 (dependency vulnerability scanning)
  - pip-audit>=2.0.0 (package vulnerability detection)

#### **Comprehensive Documentation**

- **Security README** (`security/README.md`):
  - Implementation overview
  - Security policy details
  - Environment setup instructions
  - Regular maintenance tasks
