# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Formation Recognition
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to detect and classify offensive and defensive formations in gameplay clips, building upon existing FormationAnalyzer and PlayerDetector components.
# Details:
1. Enhance existing FormationAnalyzer:
   - Implement missing FormationType enum
   - Create comprehensive formation templates
   - Integrate with existing PlayerDetector
2. Implement complete FormationRecognizer class:
   - Build on top of spygate/video/formation_analyzer.py
   - Use template matching for basic recognition
   - Implement ML classification for complex formations
   - Support both offensive and defensive formations
3. Create formation database:
   - Store formation templates
   - Include formation characteristics
   - Link to playbooks
4. Implement player position mapping:
   - Leverage existing PlayerDetector (spygate/video/player_detector.py)
   - Map tracked objects to player positions
   - Identify formation variations
   - Detect pre-snap motion
5. Create formation visualization:
   - Overlay formation diagrams
   - Highlight key players
   - Show formation name and statistics
   - Integrate with existing HUD analysis
6. Implement formation statistics:
   - Track formation usage frequency
   - Analyze success rates by formation
   - Identify opponent tendencies
7. Add formation filtering in UI:
   - Filter clips by formation
   - Search by formation name
   - Group similar formations
8. Integrate with YOLOv8-based situation detection system

# Test Strategy:
1. Accuracy tests against labeled formation dataset
2. Tests for formation variations
3. Tests for pre-snap motion handling
4. Performance tests for recognition speed
5. Comparison with human classification
6. Tests for different camera angles
7. Tests for formation filtering in UI
8. Integration tests with YOLOv8-based situation detection
9. Verify FormationType enum meets test file expectations
10. Validate formation templates against test requirements
