## ü§î **QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE**

### **Priority Questions:**

1. **Which missing piece is most critical for initial release?**
2. **Should we focus on accuracy or breadth of analysis first?**
3. **What's the minimum viable product for professional analysis?**
4. **How much professional benchmarking data do we need?**
5. **Real-time analysis or post-game batch processing?** we wanna as the dev be able to use in real time but not the user cause that would be cheating

### **Technical Questions:**

6. **What video quality/format requirements are realistic?**
7. **How do we handle edge cases without overcomplicating?**
8. **Should we build all features or focus on core analysis?**
9. **How do we validate our analysis against known outcomes?**
10. **What's the user interface for reviewing analysis results?**
