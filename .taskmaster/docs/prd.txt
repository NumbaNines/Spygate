# Spygate: ML-Powered Football Gameplay Analysis Tool

Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Version: 2.5
Date: June 6, 2025
Status: Draft

1. Overview

Spygate is a Python-based desktop application for Windows, designed to revolutionize football gameplay analysis, starting with Madden NFL 25. Leveraging YOLO11 and OpenCV for computer vision, Spygate automates detection, categorization, and organization of game situations, empowering competitive players to identify mistakes, learn from them, and elevate their skills through AI-driven insights. A vibrant Discord community drives collaborative learning and feedback, enhancing skill development via clip sharing, strategy discussions, and gamification. The application supports live stream recording from Twitch and YouTube using streamlink and ffmpeg for personal use, ensuring compliance with platform terms. A Playbook Integration System allows users to select their in-game Madden NFL 25 playbook from a developer-maintained database, with developers updating plays and playbooks on the backend. The game-agnostic architecture ensures extensibility for yearly Madden releases (<4 weeks for Madden NFL 26) and future support for EA Sports College Football (<8 weeks by Q3 2026). The UI features a minimal, clean, sleek, dark theme inspired by modern SaaS applications (e.g., Notion, Linear) with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusivity, delivering an intuitive and beautiful user experience.

## Objectives

1. If we implement YOLO11-based situation detection with >90% accuracy, then players will reduce video review time by 75% because AI automation eliminates manual clip searching.

2. If we develop an intuitive PyQt interface with drag-and-drop video upload, then user adoption will increase by 50% because the tool becomes accessible to non-technical players.

3. If we achieve formation/play recognition with >85% accuracy using transfer learning, then players will improve their strategic understanding because they can analyze play-calling patterns across multiple games.

4. If we maintain video processing speed at ≤2x real-time duration, then user engagement will increase because feedback is nearly immediate.
