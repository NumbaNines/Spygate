# Task ID: 28
# Title: UI/UX Improvements for Desktop Application
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement multiple UI/UX enhancements to the desktop application including emoji removal, button resizing, repositioning elements, updating navigation redirects, and adding rounded corners for a more modern appearance.
# Details:
1. Remove emoji from upload interface:
   - Locate and modify the upload interface components in the PyQt6 codebase
   - Remove all emoji characters from labels, buttons, and tooltips
   - Ensure text-only interface maintains clarity without emoji support

2. Resize stop button to match browse files button:
   - Identify the current dimensions of the browse files button
   - Modify the stop button's size properties to match (width, height, padding)
   - Ensure consistent styling (font size, colors) between both buttons
   - Update any related CSS/QSS styling to maintain consistency

3. Reposition browse files button in analyze tab:
   - Locate the analyze tab layout in the codebase
   - Adjust the position of the browse files button for better UX
   - Ensure proper alignment with other UI elements
   - Test different layouts to determine optimal positioning

4. Update dashboard navigation redirects:
   - Modify the "Upload New Video" button to redirect to the analyze tab instead of its current destination
   - Update the "Play Builder" button to redirect to the gameplan tab
   - Ensure proper signal/slot connections for these navigation actions
   - Update any related tooltips or documentation to reflect new navigation paths

5. Add rounded corners to main window:
   - Implement rounded corners on the main application window using PyQt6 styling
   - Use QSS to define border-radius property for the main window
   - Ensure compatibility across operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Test different radius values (8px, 10px, 12px) to determine the most visually appealing option

6. Implementation considerations:
   - Maintain the existing FACEIT-style dark theme (#0f0f0f, #1a1a1a backgrounds with #ff6b35 accent)
   - Ensure all UI changes are responsive and maintain proper layout at different window sizes
   - Follow existing styling patterns for consistency
   - Document all UI changes in code comments and update any relevant UI documentation

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual inspection testing:
   - Verify emoji removal from all parts of the upload interface
   - Confirm stop button and browse files button have identical dimensions
   - Check that browse files button is properly positioned in the analyze tab
   - Verify navigation redirects work correctly for both "Upload New Video" and "Play Builder" buttons
   - Confirm main window displays with properly rounded corners on all supported platforms

2. Responsive design testing:
   - Test the UI at multiple window sizes (800x600, 1280x720, 1920x1080)
   - Verify all elements maintain proper alignment and proportions when resizing
   - Check that rounded corners render correctly at different window sizes

3. Cross-platform testing:
   - Test UI changes on Windows 10/11, macOS, and Ubuntu Linux
   - Verify consistent appearance across all supported platforms
   - Document any platform-specific rendering issues

4. User flow testing:
   - Create test scenarios for common user journeys
   - Verify that the new navigation redirects improve user workflow
   - Time completion of common tasks before and after changes to measure improvement

5. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify that all UI elements remain accessible with keyboard navigation
   - Check that button sizes meet minimum touch/click target guidelines
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast is maintained for all UI elements

6. Regression testing:
   - Verify that existing functionality continues to work correctly
   - Ensure no new UI bugs are introduced by these changes
   - Test integration with all dependent components
