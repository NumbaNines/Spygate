# Task ID: 29
# Title: Backend Architecture Documentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Document the complete backend architecture including the 5-class model system, enhanced YOLOv8 pipeline with hardware optimization, HUD detector with OCR processing, game state extraction logic, and cross-game universal detection architecture.
# Details:
1. Document the 5-class model system:
   - Create comprehensive UML diagrams showing class relationships and inheritance
   - Document the VideoProcessor, HardwareDetector, TierOptimizer, GameDetector, and SituationDetector classes
   - Detail method signatures, parameters, return types, and class attributes
   - Explain design patterns used (Factory, Strategy, Observer patterns)

2. Document the enhanced YOLOv8 pipeline:
   - Detail the model architecture modifications for HUD element detection
   - Document the hardware optimization techniques implemented
   - Explain the frame sampling strategy based on hardware tier
   - Document the integration points with OpenCV and PyTorch
   - Include performance benchmarks across different hardware configurations

3. Document the HUD detector with OCR processing:
   - Detail the OCR engine integration (Tesseract)
   - Document preprocessing steps for text recognition optimization
   - Explain confidence scoring and validation mechanisms
   - Document the text parsing and normalization algorithms
   - Include game-specific OCR configurations and adaptations

4. Document game state extraction logic:
   - Detail the state machine implementation for tracking game progression
   - Document the event detection and classification system
   - Explain the temporal analysis for situation detection
   - Document the data structures used for state representation
   - Include error handling and recovery mechanisms

5. Document cross-game universal detection architecture:
   - Detail the abstraction layers enabling cross-game compatibility
   - Document the configuration system for game-specific adaptations
   - Explain the interface mapping between different game versions
   - Document the feature detection fallback mechanisms
   - Include extension points for adding new game support

6. Create comprehensive API documentation:
   - Document all public methods with parameters and return values
   - Include usage examples for each major component
   - Document configuration options and their effects
   - Explain error codes and troubleshooting approaches

7. Include system diagrams:
   - Create data flow diagrams showing information passing between components
   - Document the processing pipeline from video input to situation detection
   - Include sequence diagrams for key operations
   - Create component diagrams showing system boundaries and interfaces

# Test Strategy:
1. Documentation completeness verification:
   - Create a checklist of all required documentation sections
   - Verify each section is complete with appropriate diagrams, code examples, and explanations
   - Ensure all classes, methods, and attributes are documented
   - Validate that all integration points between components are clearly explained

2. Technical accuracy verification:
   - Have at least two senior developers review the documentation for technical accuracy
   - Cross-reference documentation against actual implementation code
   - Verify that all described algorithms match the implemented code
   - Ensure performance claims are backed by benchmark data
   - Check that all diagrams correctly represent the actual system architecture

3. Documentation usability testing:
   - Have a developer unfamiliar with the system attempt to understand it using only the documentation
   - Ask them to identify any unclear sections or missing information
   - Have them attempt to explain the system architecture back to the team
   - Document and address any areas of confusion

4. Integration with existing documentation:
   - Verify that the new documentation integrates with existing project documentation
   - Ensure consistent terminology and formatting
   - Check for contradictions with existing documentation
   - Update any outdated information in related documentation

5. Documentation accessibility:
   - Ensure documentation is available in the project wiki or documentation system
   - Verify that all diagrams have text alternatives for accessibility
   - Check that code examples are properly formatted and syntax highlighted
   - Ensure documentation follows the project's style guide

6. Version control and maintenance plan:
   - Establish a process for keeping documentation updated as the system evolves
   - Create a documentation review checklist for future code changes
   - Set up automated reminders for documentation reviews after significant changes
