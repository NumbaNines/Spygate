# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Frame Extraction System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system to efficiently extract and process frames from video clips for analysis.
# Details:
1. Design frame extraction module:
   - Create FrameExtractor class with OpenCV
   - Implement efficient frame sampling (e.g., 1-5 fps based on motion)
   - Support batch processing for multiple clips
2. Implement preprocessing pipeline:
   - Frame resizing for consistent analysis
   - Color normalization
   - Region of interest (ROI) selection for HUD elements
3. Create caching system:
   - Store extracted frames efficiently
   - Implement LRU cache for frequently accessed frames
   - Support disk-based caching for large videos
4. Add parallel processing support:
   - Use multiprocessing for frame extraction
   - Implement thread pool for preprocessing
5. Create progress tracking and reporting:
   - Implement callback system for progress updates
   - Add cancellation support
6. Optimize for performance:
   - GPU acceleration where available
   - Memory usage optimization
7. Add error handling and recovery:
   - Handle corrupt frames
   - Support resuming interrupted extractions

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for frame extraction functions
2. Unit tests for preprocessing pipeline
3. Integration tests for caching system
4. Performance tests for parallel processing
5. Memory usage tests
6. Error handling tests with corrupt videos
7. Benchmark tests comparing different extraction strategies
8. Tests with videos of varying quality and resolution
