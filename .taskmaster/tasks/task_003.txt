# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop VideoTimeline Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core VideoTimeline component for clip playback, navigation, and annotation display.
# Details:
1. Design VideoTimeline UI component with PyQt6:
   - Create QWidget-based timeline with frame markers
   - Implement video playback controls (play, pause, seek)
   - Add timeline scrubbing functionality
   - Design annotation overlay system for situation markers
   - Include player name display
2. Implement video playback engine:
   - Use OpenCV for frame extraction and display
   - Support H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9 codecs
   - Optimize for smooth playback
3. Create timeline navigation features:
   - Frame-by-frame navigation
   - Jump to markers/annotations
   - Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
4. Implement annotation display system:
   - Show situation markers on timeline
   - Display formation recognition results
   - Highlight detected mistakes with red indicators
5. Add player filtering capability:
   - Filter timeline view by player_name
   - Toggle between self and opponent clips
6. Ensure accessibility compliance:
   - Add keyboard navigation
   - Include ARIA labels for screen readers
   - Support high-contrast mode
7. Optimize performance for smooth playback and scrubbing

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for timeline navigation functions
2. Unit tests for video playback engine
3. Integration tests for annotation display
4. UI tests for playback controls
5. UI tests for timeline scrubbing
6. Performance tests for smooth playback
7. Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation
8. Accessibility tests for screen reader compatibility
9. Cross-codec compatibility tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop VideoTimeline UI with PyQt6 [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic UI structure for the VideoTimeline component using PyQt6
### Details:
Design and implement the main layout, video display area, timeline slider, and control buttons (play, pause, stop). Ensure the UI is responsive and follows accessibility guidelines.

## 2. Implement Video Playback Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop a robust video playback system using OpenCV with support for multiple codecs
### Details:
Integrate OpenCV for video processing, implement frame-by-frame playback, and ensure smooth playback for various video formats. Include error handling for unsupported codecs.

## 3. Create Timeline Navigation Features [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Develop interactive timeline navigation functionality
### Details:
Implement timeline scrubbing, frame-accurate seeking, and keyboard shortcuts for navigation. Add visual indicators for current position and key frames on the timeline.

## 4. Develop Annotation System [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3
### Description: Create a system for adding, editing, and displaying annotations on the timeline
### Details:
Implement functionality to add text annotations, markers, and region selections on the timeline. Develop a data structure to store and retrieve annotations efficiently.

## 5. Optimize Performance and Conduct Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Optimize the VideoTimeline component for performance and conduct comprehensive testing
### Details:
Profile and optimize video rendering and timeline interactions for smooth performance. Implement the detailed test strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.
