# Critical Bug Fixes Applied

## 1. Game State Preservation (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Clips were using the current game state instead of the state when the situation was detected
- **Solution**: Deep copy game state and situation context before creating clips
- **Impact**: Clips now correctly show the game state at the moment of detection

## 2. Situation Type Mapping (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Analyzer returns compound types like "third_and_long_red_zone" but UI only checks "3rd_long"
- **Solution**: Enhanced mapping function to handle all compound situation types
- **Impact**: All detected situations now properly map to user preferences

## 3. Duplicate Detection (ENHANCED)
- **Problem**: Multiple clips created for the same play
- **Solution**: Added down/distance tracking to prevent duplicate clips for same situation
- **Impact**: Reduced duplicate clips while maintaining coverage

## 4. Clip Duration (LIMITED)
- **Problem**: Clips could span multiple plays
- **Solution**: Limited maximum clip duration to 12 seconds (typical play length)
- **Impact**: Each clip now contains only one play

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Run analysis on a video with known plays
2. Verify clips show correct down/distance in their labels
3. Check that compound situations (e.g., "3rd & Long in Red Zone") create clips
4. Confirm no duplicate clips for the same play
5. Verify clip duration is reasonable (3-12 seconds)
