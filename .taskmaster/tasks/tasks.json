          "details": "🔧 **CRITICAL 30% FREEZE ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED**\n\n**Problem Analysis:**\nUser reports video analysis freezes at 30% during upload. After investigation, identified multiple potential causes:\n\n**Root Causes Found:**\n1. **Threading Issues**: PyQt signals emitted from background threads not properly handled\n2. **Progress Spam**: Too many progress updates causing UI thread blocking\n3. **Missing Error Handling**: No recovery mechanisms for failed frames\n4. **Import Dependencies**: Missing core module imports causing silent failures\n5. **Signal Connection Issues**: Cross-thread signal emission without proper Qt mechanisms\n\n**Solutions Implemented:**\n\n**1. Created Debug Tool (`debug_video_analysis.py`):**\n- Isolated debugging environment to test video analysis\n- Extensive logging around 30% critical zone\n- Thread-safe signal emission testing\n- Memory and processing validation\n\n**2. Created Fixed Application (`spygate_desktop_app_fixed.py`):**\n- **Thread Safety**: Used `QTimer.singleShot(0, lambda...)` for thread-safe signal emission\n- **Daemon Threads**: Made analysis threads daemon to prevent hanging\n- **Progress Optimization**: Only emit progress updates when values change\n- **Error Recovery**: Continue processing even if individual frames fail\n- **Stop Functionality**: Proper stop button implementation\n- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with user feedback\n- **Hardware Fallback**: Graceful degradation when hardware detection fails\n\n**Key Technical Fixes:**\n```python\n# OLD (problematic):\nself.analysis_progress.emit(progress, message)\n\n# NEW (thread-safe):\nQTimer.singleShot(0, lambda p=progress, m=message: self.analysis_progress.emit(p, m))\n```\n\n**Testing Instructions:**\n1. Run `python debug_video_analysis.py` first to verify basic functionality\n2. Run `python spygate_desktop_app_fixed.py` for the corrected application\n3. Test with the same video that previously froze at 30%\n\n**Status:** Ready for user testing - solutions implemented and documented",
