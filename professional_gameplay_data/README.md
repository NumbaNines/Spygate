2. **Strategic Context**: Formation identification, personnel packages, field position impact
3. **Decision Quality**: Pre-snap reads, play-calling logic, execution assessment
4. **Outcome Correlation**: Success metrics tied to decision-making patterns

## Training Pipeline

### Professional Model Training

1. **Data Preparation**: Professional footage ‚Üí standardized format
2. **Annotation**: High-quality strategic annotations
3. **Model Training**: YOLOv8 + strategic analysis layers
4. **Validation**: Against known professional benchmarks
5. **Benchmarking**: Comparison with casual gameplay models

### Model Outputs

- **Professional Benchmark Model**: "Gold standard" for decision analysis
- **Comparison Framework**: Tools for evaluating casual vs professional gaps
- **Coaching Insights**: Actionable feedback based on professional patterns

## Usage Examples

### Training a Professional Benchmark Model

```python
from spygate.ml.professional_trainer import ProfessionalModelTrainer

trainer = ProfessionalModelTrainer(
    data_path="professional_gameplay_data/annotations/yolo_format/",
    model_type="benchmark",
    quality_threshold="professional"
)

model = trainer.train()
```

### Analyzing Decision Quality

```python
from spygate.analysis.decision_analyzer import DecisionQualityAnalyzer

analyzer = DecisionQualityAnalyzer(
    professional_model_path="professional_gameplay_data/models/benchmark_models/yolov8_pro.pt"
)

quality_score = analyzer.analyze_clip("user_gameplay.mp4")
# Returns: Professional similarity score, improvement suggestions
```

### Benchmarking Against Professional Standards

```python
from spygate.benchmarks.coaching_metrics import CoachingBenchmark

benchmark = CoachingBenchmark(
    professional_data_path="professional_gameplay_data/analysis_results/"
)

coaching_report = benchmark.generate_report("user_decisions.json")
# Returns: Detailed coaching insights based on professional patterns
```

## Data Collection Guidelines

### Video Selection Criteria

1. **Strategic Importance**: Focus on decision-heavy situations (3rd down, red zone, two-minute warning)
2. **Quality Coaching**: Games featuring renowned coaches and strategic innovation
3. **Diverse Situations**: Variety of down/distance, field position, and game state scenarios
4. **Clear Outcomes**: Situations where decision quality can be objectively measured

### Professional Standards

- Source only from games featuring professional/elite college coaching
- Prioritize plays that demonstrate strategic excellence
- Include both successful and unsuccessful plays for learning
- Maintain metadata about coaching staff, opponent quality, and situational context
