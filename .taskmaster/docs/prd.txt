# Spygate: ML-Powered Football Gameplay Analysis Tool

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Version**: 2.7
**Date**: June 6, 2025
**Status**: Draft

## 1. Overview
Spygate is a Python-based desktop application for Windows, designed to revolutionize football gameplay analysis, starting with Madden NFL 25. Leveraging YOLO11 and OpenCV for computer vision, Spygate automates detection, categorization, and organization of game situations, empowering competitive players to analyze both their own and opponents' gameplay clips to identify mistakes, optimize strategies, and elevate skills through AI-driven insights. A vibrant Discord community drives collaborative learning, enabling clip sharing, strategy discussions, and gamification. The application supports live stream recording from Twitch and YouTube using `streamlink` and `ffmpeg` or OBS Studio screen capture for personal use, ensuring compliance with platform terms. A Playbook Integration System allows users to select their in-game Madden NFL 25 playbook from a developer-maintained database, with updates managed on the backend. The game-agnostic architecture ensures extensibility for yearly Madden releases (<4 weeks for Madden NFL 26) and future support for EA Sports College Football (<8 weeks by Q3 2026). The UI features a minimal, clean, sleek, dark theme inspired by modern SaaS applications (e.g., Notion, Linear) with a YouTube-like dashboard and easy navigation bar, achieving WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusivity and delivering an intuitive user experience.

## 12. Notes
**Development Priorities**
- **Data Collection**: 200+ hours of Madden NFL 25 footage required; crowdsource 50% (>50 hours) via Discord, 50% from [Huddle.gg](https://huddle.gg/playbooks/), [Madden School](https://www.madden-school.com/playbooks/). Start pre-Task 7 to support YOLO11 training (Task 7, Subtask 3).
- **Hardware Considerations**: Local processing primary, cloud fallback. For OBS, recommend minimum specs (e.g., 8GB RAM, dedicated GPU) to mitigate performance overhead.
- **Community Engagement**: Discord server setup critical; host weekly events (e.g., clip contests, pro AMAs) to drive >500 members; implement moderation with inclusive guidelines. Start pre-Task 7 to crowdsource opponent clips.
- **Legal Compliance**: Complete review by Phase 2; engage counsel early in Phase 1 to assess OBS and `streamlink` methods for opponent stream recording.
- **Extensibility Planning**: Document architecture for College Football 2026.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast mode, screen reader support by Phase 3. Implement pre-Task 7 to enhance Task 3’s UI (VideoTimeline).
- **UI Development**: Use Cursor with PyQt6 for rapid UI coding, focusing on YouTube-like dashboard with `player_name` filtering. Prioritize accessibility with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, high-contrast mode. Test on Windows 10/11 for performance (<2s load time) and WCAG compliance. Implement pre-Task 7 for Task 7’s visualization (Subtask 8).
- **Stream Recording Options**: Prototype OBS screen capture pre-Task 7 as an alternative to `streamlink`/`ffmpeg`, validating feasibility for Task 14. Provide user choice in Community page, with compliance modal and `player_name` tagging.
- **Testing**: Expand pytest tests for Tasks 1-6 (Task 3’s VideoTimeline, Task 4’s FrameExtractor, Task 5’s MotionDetector, Task 6’s ObjectTracker) to ensure ≥85% coverage pre-Task 7, supporting YOLO11 reliability.
- **Opponent Clip Support**: Ensure all features (Tasks 2-15) support self and opponent clips with `player_name` tagging, stored in SQLite, and filterable in UI (Clips, Analytics, Community pages). Critical for pro scouting and analytics.

**Business Model**
- Freemium Approach: Free tier drives adoption, premium tier provides sustainability.
- Community-Driven Growth: Discord incentives (e.g., badges for opponent clip contributions) crucial for retention.
- Platform Compliance: Twitch/YouTube terms compliance for stream recording, enforced via modal for OBS and `streamlink`.

**Accessibility Commitment**
- WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance: >90% by Enhanced Release.
- Progressive Enhancement: Accessible across proficiency levels.
- Community Inclusivity: Discord moderation and inclusive guidelines.

**Future Considerations**
- EA Sports College Football: Monitor 2025 release, prepare plugin architecture.
- Console Integration: Feasibility study by Q4 2026.
- Mobile Companion: Consider mobile app for clip viewing and community interaction.

## 13. Source Control & Infrastructure
**Repository Structure**
- Primary Repository: [github.com/spygate/spygate-core](https://github.com/spygate/spygate-core)
- Documentation: [github.com/spygate/spygate-docs](https://github.com/spygate/spygate-docs)
- Community: [github.com/spygate/spygate-community](https://github.com/spygate/spygate-community)

**CI/CD Pipeline**
- Linting: Black formatting, flake8 style checking (PR triggers linting).
- Testing: Pytest with 85% coverage (PR triggers testing).
- Deployment: Automated staging deployment (PR merges trigger test server update).
- Monitoring: Sentry for error tracking, Prometheus for performance (API latency, error rates, clip processing time).

**Infrastructure Management**
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform for cloud resources.
- Container Orchestration: Docker for consistent Windows environments.
- Database Management: PostgreSQL with daily backups to AWS S3, SQLite fallback.
- Cloud Services: AWS (S3, EC2) for optional cloud processing, GCP as backup.
